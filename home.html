	<br>
	<p>My passion for web development was discovered during High School, where I took many advanced computer classes.</p>
	<p>The passion never died, only supressed by lifes many challenges.</p>
	<p>After High school, I started a family, and began purusing a career in HVAC to better support them.</p>
	<p>Yes, I did put my dream career on hold, with intentions on returning to pursue.</p>
	<p>Over the past 4 years, I have attended Maysville Community and Technical College. I now hold certificates in HVAC and Industrial Maintenance.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>I now have 3 years of experience in the HVAC field. </p>
