	<p>Currently I'm working as an HVAC/R Technician.</p>
	
	<p>Mechanical aptitude wasnt a natural skill but with my current experience I have prevailed through the challenge.
		<br>
	My current career proves my abilty to trouble shoot and work through difficult situations.</p>
	<p>I am a faster learner, and have the confidence and skills to be a valuable Web Developer.
		<br>
	While in high school, I took several web design and advanced classes to gain the skills I have now.</p>
	<p>Since I discovered my passion for web design and development, it has been my passion to puruse as a career.
		<br>
	My career path didnt go as planned, as life usually doesnt. Through building a family, I chose to pursue HVAC in order to support them.
	<br>
	I have been with my current employer for 2 years and am ready to pursue a new career as a Web Developer.</p>

<p> During my High School career, I designed and developed the Montgomery County Area Technogy Center's web page. <br><br>
	The site was live for over 4 years, and has since then been taken down. I was proud of that project, and enjoyed completing it.<br><br>
	Unfortunatly; after graduation, I went straight into the work force, and started a family.<br><br>
	Desperate for a good paying job in a quick time frame, I attended Maysville Community and Technical College and pursued a degree in HVAC.<br><br>
	Also obtained a degree in Industrial Maintenance. I have been in the HVAC field for over 3 years now. I have been with my current employer for 2 years.<br><br>
	Throughout the long days and nights spent on top of roof tops on commercial buildings, I realized that the career I had chosen wasnt the right fit for me.<br><br>
	I began questioning my choices, and finally realized what my dream career was, which is Web development. I enjoy it with such a passion.<br><br>
	I then began to re-teach myself how to code. In fact, this entire site was built with straight HTML and CSS.<br><br>
	I began enrolling back into Maysville Community and Technical College to pursue a degree in Web Development.<br><br>
	I have always had a love for computer technology, and still do.<br><br>
	I know that I am a perfect fit for this field because most of all, I enjoy buidling web sites, turning code into a working interface.
